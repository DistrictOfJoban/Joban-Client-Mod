# JCM v2.1.0-beta.3 for MTR 4.0.2 has been released!

**Note: Normal players are *strongly* advised to wait until the official release of v2.1.0.**

## Change (Scripting Implementation)

### Execution
- Script Execution are now changed so that the same type of script are executed orderly in the same thread (No longer parallelized per-instance). This should hopefully alleviate some multithreading issues with scripts.
