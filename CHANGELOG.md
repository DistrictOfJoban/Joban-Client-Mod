## (JCM v2.0.0 beta.7) for (MTR 4.0.0-beta.13) has been released!

**New:**
- **Scripting**
- - Extend scripting support to MTR Decoration Block/Eyecandy
- - Note: This change is likely not useful to most players & developers, as support for model loading is very simplistic. Most if not all scripts from MTR 3/NTE will fail to load.
- Disneyland Resorts Line APG now reacts to redstone signal just like built-in APGs in MTR 4
- **JSON PIDS Preset**
- - The PIDS Variable `{worldPlayer}` is now implemented and displayed correctly again

**Changes:**
- **Scripting**
- - Scripts that points to an invalid location will now error out in the console
- Most blocks can now be crafted with a crafting recipe and drop items again, making it possible to use survival mode with JCM (Albeit still need improvements)
- - This currently only covers blocks added in JCM v1, new blocks added in JCM v2 don't have a recipe nor item drops yet.
