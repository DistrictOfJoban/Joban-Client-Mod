## JCM (v2.0.0-prerelease.1) for (MTR 4.0.0-prerelease.2) has been released!

**Changes:**
- To adapt to the new train driver key changes in MTR 4, **Operator Button** now allows choosing which driver keys are allowed.
- - Configurable via brush
- The JCM **Standing Station Name Block** has been moved to the official MTR Mod!
- - The JCM variant will be kept for backward compatibility, but will no longer be obtainable in the inventory.

**Fixes:**
- Fix JSON PIDS ETA text potentially not following the destination's language
- Fix Scripted PIDS Preset not working reliably
- Fix some textures not being power-of-two resolution. The mipmap level can now be raised to 2 with solely MTR and JCM installed.
