## (JCM v2.0.0 beta.7) for (MTR 4.0.0-beta.13) has been released!

**New:**
- Disneyland Resorts Line APG now reacts to redstone signal just like built-in APGs in MTR 4
- **JSON PIDS Preset**
- - The PIDS Variable `{worldPlayer}` is now implemented and displayed correctly again

**Changes:**
- Most blocks can now be crafted with a crafting recipe and drop items again, making it possible to use survival mode with JCM (Albeit still need improvements)
- - This currently only covers blocks added in JCM v1, new blocks added in JCM v2 don't have a recipe nor item drops yet.
