Joban Client Mod is an addon mod for the **Minecraft Transit Railway 4.0**, adding various blocks from **Emergency stop button**, **Helpline** to fully customizable Passenger Information Display System and more!  

This repository contains the source code for Joban Client Mod.

## Future plans
Due to the shift away from **Minecraft Mappings** in the upcoming MTR version, JCM will need to make sweeping changes to adapt.

A [port of JCM v2 for NeoMTR (MTR 3/Architectury)](https://github.com/DistrictOfJoban/NeoMTR/tree/lx/common/src/main/java/com/lx862/jcm) have been made, which is expected to align closer with the architectury port of MTR.
